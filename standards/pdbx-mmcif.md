description: |
    Protein Data Bank archive (PDB) is the single worldwide archival repository 
    of information about the 3D structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex 
    assemblies, managed by the Worldwide PDB (wwPDB). The PDB Exchange Dictionary 
    (PDBx) is used by the wwPDB to define data content for deposition, annotation 
    and archiving of PDB entries. PDBx incorporates the community standard metadata 
    representation, the Macromolecular Crystallographic Information Framework 
    (mmCIF), orginally developed under the auspices of the International Union of 
    Crystallography (IUCr). PDBx has been extended by the wwPDB to include 
    descriptions of other experimental methods that produce 3D macromolecular 
    structure models such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, 3D Electron 
    Microscopy and Tomography.
