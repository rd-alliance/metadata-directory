description: |
  <p>RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight
  approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It is
  based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make 
  best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and 
  practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an 
  individual researcher working with a folder of data, to 
  large data-intensive computational research environments.</p>
