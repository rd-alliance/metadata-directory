description: >
  <p>A widely used, international standard for describing data from the
  social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Two versions of the standard
  are currently maintained in parallel:</p><ul><li>DDI Codebook (or DDI
  version 2) is the simpler of the two, and intended for documenting
  simple survey data for exchange or archiving. Version 2.5 was released in
  January 2014.</li><li>DDI Lifecycle (or DDI version 3) is richer and may
  be used to document datasets at each stage of their lifecycle from
  conceptualization through to publication and reuse. It is modular and
  extensible. Version 3.2 was published in March 2014.</li></ul><p>Both
  versions are XML-based and defined using XML Schemas. They were developed
  and are maintained by the DDI Alliance.</p>
