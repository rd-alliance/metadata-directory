description: |
  <p>The Standard for Documentation of Astronomical Catalogues is a set of
  conventions for archiving astronomical data. As well as path, filename and
  data format conventions, it also specifies how to construct a plain text
  description file for documenting the data files. It was developed as an
  alternative to FITS that would be more suited to archives, permit human
  inspection, and allow manipulation via standard Unix command-line tools.</p>
  <p>SDAC was developed by CDS (Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg).
  Version 2.0 is the most recent; it was released in February 2000.</p>
