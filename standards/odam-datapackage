title: ODAM Structural Metadata 
slug: odam-datapackage
description: <p>Open Data for Access and Mining (ODAM) Structural Metadata is a format describing how the metadata should be formatted and what should be included to ensure ODAM compliance for a data set. To comply with this format, two metadata files in TSV format are required in addition to the data file(s). These two files describe the metadata of the dataset, which includes descriptions of measures and structural metadata like references between tables. The metadata lets non-expert users explore and visualize your data. By making data interoperable and reusable by both humans and machines, it also encourages data dissemination according to FAIR principles. The structural metadata is specified in section 'Data collection and preparation' on the website.</p>
