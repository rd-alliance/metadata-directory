slug: csmd-cclrc-core-scientific-metadata-model
description: <p>A study-data oriented model, primarily in support of the ICAT data
  managment infrastructure software. The CSMD is designed to support data collected
  within a large-scale facility&#8217;s scientific workflow; however the model is
  also designed to be generic across scientific disciplines.</p><p>Sponsored by the
  Science and Technologies Facilities Council, there is reference to CSMD 3.0 development
  in 2010; however, the latest full specification available is v 2.0, from 2004.</p>
