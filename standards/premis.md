  <p>The PREMIS (Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies) Data
  Dictionary defines a set of metadata that most repositories of digital objects
  would need to record and use in order to preserve those objects over the long
  term. It has its roots in the Open Archival Information System Reference
  Model but has been strongly influenced by the practical experience of such
  repositories. While the Data Dictionary can be used with other standards to
  influence the creation of local application profiles, an XML Schema is
  provided to allow the metadata to be serialized independently.</p>
  <p>PREMIS was initially developed by the Preservation Metadata: Implementation
  Strategies Working Group, convened by OCLC and RLG, and is currently
  maintained by the PREMIS Maintenance Activity, lead by the Library of
  Congress.</p>
