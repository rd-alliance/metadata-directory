description: |
  <p>openPMD provides naming and attribute conventions that allow the exchange
    of particle and mesh based data from scientific simulations and experiments.
    The primary goal is to define a minimal set/kernel of meta information that
    enables the sharing and exchange of data to achieve</p>
  <ul>
    <li>portability between various applications and differing algorithms;</li>
    <li>a unified open-access description for scientific data (publishing and archiving);</li>
    <li>a unified description for post-processing, visualization and analysis.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>openPMD suits any kind of hierarchical, self-describing data format, such
     as, but not limited to ADIOS1 (BP3), ADIOS2 (BP4), HDF5, JSON, and XML.</p>
