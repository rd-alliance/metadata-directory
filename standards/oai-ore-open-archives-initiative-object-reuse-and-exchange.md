title: OAI-ORE - Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange
slug: oai-ore-open-archives-initiative-object-reuse-and-exchange
description: <p>The goal of these standards is to expose the rich content in aggregations
  of Web resources to applications that support authoring, deposit, exchange, visualization,
  reuse, and preservation. The standards support the changing nature of scholarship
  and scholarly communication, and the need for cyberinfrastructure to support that
  scholarship, with the intent to develop standards that generalize across all web-based
  information including the increasing popular social networks of &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;.</p>
