  <p><b>Geometa</b> is an R package that offers facilities to handle reading and writing 
  of geographic metadata defined with OGC/ISO 19115, 11119 and 19110 geographic information 
  metadata standards, and encoded using the ISO 19139 (XML) standard. It also includes a 
  facility to check the validity of ISO 19139 XML encoded metadata. The package can be used 
  in integrated (meta)data management flows to generate business metadata compliant with ISO/OGC 
  standards. Metadata generated with geometa can then be published to standard web metadata 
  catalogues by means of related R packages such as <a href="http://github.com/eblondel/ows4R/wiki" target="_blank">ows4R</a> 
  (R interface to OGC Web-Services) or <a href="http://github.com/eblondel/geonapi/wiki" target="_blank">geonapi</a> (R Interface to GeoNetwork API).</p>
