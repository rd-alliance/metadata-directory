slug: openaire-guidelines
description: <p>The OpenAIRE Guidelines define the following application profiles based on established standards,
  <a href="../standards/dublin-core.html">Dublin Core</a> metadata schema for publication repositories, 
  <a href="../standards/datacite-metadata-schema.html">Data Cite</a> metadata schema  for data archives and 
  <a href="../standards/cerif.html">CERIF</a> for current research information systems.
  While each schema is dedicated for different entities (publications, datasets, research information) 
  they allow for interlinking and contextualisation of research artefacts.</p>
